Subject: Request for Salary Discussion

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to request a meeting to discuss my current salary.
Over the past 2 years, I have taken on additional responsibilities and successfully led a team.

Because of my hard work and the value I bring to the team, I think it's a good time to discuss a possible 
raise in my salary.

Please let me know a convenient time for you to have this discussion. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
DishaÂ Patel
